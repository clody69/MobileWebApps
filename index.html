Description of the course
</h1>
<p>
HTML5 introduces many new features, technologies and APIs that enable web developers to create apps and websites that
are fast, responsive, stunningly beautiful and resemble the experience of desktop applications. Now supporting multimedia
content (audio, video and graphics), data communication methods (like websockets), offline usage, local storage, access
to local resources (like camera), the Web is becoming a popular platform for building mobile web applications that can
run on phones, tablets, smartphones and behave like native applications.
</p>
<p>
In this course you will learn how to build mobile web applications with HTML5. We will cover the
new concepts that HTML5 is introducing, several frameworks for facilitating the development
(e.g. jQuery Mobile, Sencha and jQTouch, Backbone.js, Mustache, Handlebar.js) and key techniques for building web
backends (e.g Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, Haml, CoffeScript). We will focus on understanding the overall end-to-end architecture
and the benefits of each technology through many examples and hands-on exercises.
</p>
<p>The course includes theory lectures, seminars, lab exercises and one group assignment.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
The students are expected to have prior programming experience in any object-oriented language and
familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Experience with MVC frameworks (like Ruby on Rails and Django) and
familiarity with the Ruby programming languages are a plus.
</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>
The course is an experiment in community outreach and co-operation. The course will be open not
only to Aalto Students but also to people working in the IT industry and startups. (everyone can particpate!).
The course is free to non-Aalto participants, but everybody is expected to follow the full course including
all home work. Aalto students earn 4 credits from the course.
</p>
<p>
The maximum number of participants in the course will be 50. Out of the 50 seats, we will reserve
18 seats for students from outside Aalto.
If you are not an Aalto student or study at Aalto ARTS or School of Economics
(which cannot regesiter via WebOodi) please send email to
<a href='mailto:hakan.mitts@aalto.fi'>Håkan Mitts</a>
to register.
</p>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>
Students are expected to attend 80% of the lectures and submit the course assignments.
Assignments will be done in teams of 2-3 persons.
</p>
<h2>Grades</h2>
<p>The final grade is based on the performance on the course’s exercises. Exercises are evaluated based on their design, functionality, correctness and style.</p>

<h1>Assignment</h1>
<p>
During the course the students are required to complete an assignment under the supervision of the instructors.
The assignment aims at involving the students in a real world and hands-on experience on what it’s like to create
a new web application for a new or existing product, for a new company or a new startup or just for turning an
idea into reality. To make it as real as possible to the real world, the assignment will be conducted in
cooperation with the Aalto Venture Garage. The assignment is team based and will be conducted with the following schedule:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Kick-off (12 March 2012)</strong>
: after a brief introduction on the goals and expectations of the assignment,
we will run a group forming exercise where the participants will have a possibility
to discuss new or ongoing activities related to mobile web apps. The expectation is that
at the end of the exercise, the teams will have identified some interesting topics for
assignments.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Proposal submission (19 March 2012)</strong>
: one week after the kick-off the teams must submit a proposal for the assignment.
The proposal must state very clearly what mobile application they indend to build,
what technologies will be used and what will be the contribution of the each individual
(mixing with people outside of the course is possible but each individual contribution
must be stated upfront). The proposals will be reviewed by the review board.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mid-term review (23 April 2012)</strong>
: the teams will be requested to make a mid-term review of their work in order to
collect feedback on the development of their assignment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Final review (15 and 22 May 2012)</strong>
: each team will present the outcome of their assignments
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The assignment will be evaluated by the course’s board (consisting of least 5 memebers) based
on the quality of the final outcome and weekly progress. Grading will based on team results
and on the individual participation and contribution.
</p>
<p>
All teams are requested to create a git repository at
<a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a>
where to submit the web application and related documenation. It’s important that each team setups
a blog/journal where the progress can be monitored (e.g. on the GitHub repository page or through the issue management tool).

          %p Article was written by editor in chief Chris Anderson and said that WWW is in declide as simpler, sleeker services -the apps- are less about searching and more about getting.
          A study shows that people spend more time with apps rather than on the web.

            Mobile Apps Platform Fragmentation
          
          %p
            There have been 16 total mobile platforms[1], 10 of which are still (or soon will be) on the market. Of the six that were terminated, three had replacements built by the same orchestrating company (Windows Mobile begat Windows Phone; Maemo begat MeeGo, and PalmOS eventually led to WebOS.) Only three reached end of life with no known descendant (iMode, MeeGo[2] and Symbian).

          %p
            Operating systems that were launched in the 1990s or early 2000s have mostly been withdrawn/replaced with the exception of Java and BREW.  ”Modern” operating systems all emerged after 2007 (following iOS). A total of eight such new OSs were introduced in four years[3].
